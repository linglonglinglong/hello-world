Here are some of the examples of my work related to UI/UX design and implementation. I'm sorry that I do not have a good website for them for now because they are quite scattered in themes and formats due to various constraints of the projects. And I have yet to find a good place to hold them together (for free). If you see a github link, you can see the codes of that project in the same repository.


Yougame: Designed and implemented the entire front-end (scan the QR code to download the game on phone, or search 整两把棋牌 on Google Play or App Store to see the screenshots. Otherwise you will need to login with WeChat to play the game)
